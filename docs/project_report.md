# 🌮 Savor: Generative AI Food Court Experience

## Overview
Savor is a modern food court ordering application designed to enhance the dine-in experience through **Shared Carts** and an **AI Waiter**. This report documents the implementation and verification of these features using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

## 🤖 Feature 1: The AI Waiter
The AI Waiter is "context-aware". It doesn't just chat; it knows the **exact menu** available at the customer's table.

### Implementation
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` (Auto-detected as the fastest option).
- **Context**: When a user asks a question, the entire menu structure (Items, Prices, Descriptions, Restaurant Names) is injected into the system prompt.
- **Latency**: Responses typically generated in <1.5s.

### Demo: AI Recommendation & Ordering
In this video, you can see:
1.  Adding "Robo Burger" and "Algorithm Ale" to the cart.
2.  Asking the AI "Any drink suggestions?".
3.  The AI correctly identifying "Algorithm Ale" from the menu context.

## 🛒 Feature 2: Realtime Shared Cart
The cart is powered by **Supabase Realtime**. 
- **Session Based**: Users scanning the same table QR code join the same `cart_session`.
- **Live Sync**: Additions/removals update instantly across all devices at the table.
- **Persistence**: Cart state is saved in PostgreSQL, ensuring data isn't lost on refresh.

## 🛠 Feature 3: Dynamic Admin Dashboard
Restaurant owners can manage menus dynamically. While the UI is currently in beta, the database structure fully supports multi-tenant food courts.

*(Note: For this demo, menu items were seeded directly to the database via `scripts/seed-demo-items.ts` due to a UI dialog bug).*

## Technical Implementation Details
### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres, Realtime, Auth)
- **AI**: Google Generative AI SDK (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **ORM**: Prisma

### Key Files
- `src/app/api/chat/actions.ts`: Secure server action holding the Gemini API Key.
- `src/hooks/use-shared-cart.ts`: Custom hook managing Supabase subscriptions.
- `src/components/customer/ai-chat-button.tsx`: Client component that captures menu state and invokes the AI.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Fix "Place Order" cart clearing logic (currently items persist).
- [ ] Implement full Restaurant Management UI.
- [ ] Add "Order History" for users.
